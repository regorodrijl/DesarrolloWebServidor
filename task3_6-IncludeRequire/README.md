Task 3.6.- Creating functions libraries with include and require

1.- Create a library with all your functions.


2.- Write the difference between include, include_once, require and require_once.


3.- Download this template and divide the index.php, to use resource files, so we'll have the following extra files as result:


--- file logo.php (contains the div id="logo")

--- file menu.php (contains the div id="menu")

--- file pictures.php (contains the div id="pictures")

--- file content.php (contains the div id="content")

--- file sidebar.php (contains the div id="sidebar")

--- file footer.php (contains the div id="footer")


Modify the index.php to use the resource files created before.
